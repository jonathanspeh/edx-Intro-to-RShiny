## Accessing data via google sheet API

Accessing API via googlesheet4 requires google account + verifications.

`gs4_auth()` - opens autentification broswer, can be included in app server
 - when included in server, after running the app (locally), the console has to be used to create access before app is functional

`range_read(ss="URL")` - allows to read in whole spreadsheet


```{r}
gs4_auth() # opens authentification Browser 
propertyTable=range_read(ss="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u_2Nn_ZeN0VdEGYJewQ2bJd_1KZzzjjUpQLwZ6_r8Uw/edit#gid=0")

```
